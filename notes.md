* Decide which ISO3 code
    - DK, take "DNK".
    - BG, take "GBR".
    - FR, take "FRA".

* Fix repetition in `land_use` and `subdivision`

* Row headers, make them all readable

* Convert all units

* Specific NaNs with all combination of identifiers.

* Recompute the line 10 (total) as a sanity check
