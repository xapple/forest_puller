Comparison report
=================


General information
-------------------
This is a comparison report that can include information from several countries and several data sources.


Processing
----------
* This report and all the analysis was generated using the `{{project_name}}` python pipeline.

* Documentation is available at:

<{{project_url}}>

* Version `{{project_version}}` of the pipeline was used.

* This document was generated at `{{now}}` on host `{{hostname}}`.

{{#git}}
* The exact git hash of the latest commit was: `{{git_hash}}`

* Also more simply referred to by its shortened tag `{{git_tag}}`.
{{/git}}

Scope and extend of data sources
--------------------------------
In the following visualizations we cover 27 of the 28 (past and present) EU member states. The list is the following and excludes Malta:

* Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom.

The plots usually run from the earliest official statistics around the year 1990 (depending on the country at hand) to the latest estimates in 2018.

Several data sources are also represented. Currently `forest_puller` provides programmatic access (via web-scraping) to the forest area data from these data sources:

* [IPCC](https://tinyurl.com/y474yu9e).
* [SOEF](https://dbsoef.foresteurope.org/).
* [FAOSTAT-GF](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/).
* [HPFFRE](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4t880qh).
* EU-CBM (an in-house custom and non-traceable dataset).

Comparison of total forest area
--------------------------------
Below we compare the total forest area as it is reported in five different data sources.

The Y-axis represents area in million of hectares. To provide better insight, the scale is not aligned between countries nor does it start at 0.

The HPFFRE dataset is post-processed before being graphed as we do not wish to show future predictions in this visualization. Instead we show the earliest year of that dataset for each country and extend it to the current year.

If the SOEF dataset is not visible for some countries, it is because the FAOSTAT source precisely matches it and covers the line of the other dataset.

Also, not all datasets are available for all countries, unfortunately.

Comparison of gain and losses
-----------------------------

Below we compare the total losses, gains and net changes in forest biomass for each country.

The Y-axis represents different units depending on the data source considered. Therefor, vertical scales are not directly comparable in the plots. Each source provides a different measure and a slightly different definition for losses and gains.

* IPCC indicates "tons of carbon per hectare (over bark)".
* SOEF indicates "cubic meters over bark per hectare".
* FAOSTAT writes: "Removals of roundwood comprise all quantities of wood felled and removed from the forest and other wooded land or other felling sites. They are measured in cubic meters under bark (without bark)".
* HPFFRE writes: "Stemwood volume measured over bark expressed as unit area volume". It further specifies: "Total stemwood volume measured over bark. Part of tree stem from the felling cut to the tree top with the branches removed, including bark".
* The EU-CBM datasets is composed of "Tons of carbon per hectare (over bark)" as reported in the [CBM-CFS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBM-CFS3) Microsoft Access database. Losses are obtained by summing `soft_production` and `hard_production`. Gains are obtained from the `gross_growth_ag` pool.

Also of note is that the X-axis is not aligned between the different subplots.

Again, not all datasets are available for all countries.

All values are per annum.

Conversion to tons of carbon
-----------------------------

Below we compare once again the total losses, gains and net changes in forest biomass for each country.

This results in a series of graphs that are almost identical to the ones above.

The difference is that we harmonize the Y axis units and convert the data sources which were providing volumes into mass. These were SOEF, FAOSTAT, HPFFRE. Namely, we convert cubic meters over/under bark per hectare to tons of carbon per hectare.

To operate this conversion, we use a dataset provided by SOEF that indicates the proportion of the 10 most common species in terms of growing stock. We then combine this information with a published table specifying wood densities for different species.

The wood density is in [tons / m³] more precisely [oven-dry tonnes of C per moist m³] and is found at:

    Chapter 4: Forest Land 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
    Table 4.14 Basic Wood Density (d) Of Selected Temperate And Boreal Tree Taxa
    https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_04_Ch4_Forest_Land.pdf
    See page 71.

The matching of the species latin as given in each country does not follow any standard and contains stochastic variations. The matching of the user inputted latin name to its canonical genus is done through natural language processing techniques and string matching strategies.

The average density values are then linearly interpolated for missing years, and padded-by-copy outside of the bounds for which data is provided.

A bark correction factor of 0.88 is applied to the FAOSTAT data source, which provided values in cubic meters under bark instead of over bark.

This value comes from: https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/timber/publications/DP-49.pdf

Comparison of the growing stock genera composition
--------------------------------------------------

Below we compare the breakdown of a country's growing stock in terms of the tree species that compose it. Namely, we plot the fraction of each genus that the country reported at four different years in the SOEF dataset.

The growing stock here is reported as volumes in cubic meters.

Comparison of the genera composition between SOEF and EU-CBM
------------------------------------------------------------

These graphs are similar to the ones above, except we produce a paired stacked barchart this time, comparing the genus breakdown of the growing stock (in terms of volume) between the SOEF dataset and the EU-CBM dataset.

Aggregation of all countries together
-------------------------------------

In the following graphs, we do not separate the results by country, but instead aggregate countries together by either summing or performing an average.

To aggregate a particular statistic and display its evolution along time, the statistic at hand must be available for every single country for each time point. This means that if a single country out of the 27 is missing the value on a particular year, say 2004, we cannot display a point for that year at all in the final graph. Displaying a statistic for the year 2004 for only 26 countries while other points concern 27 countries would break the comparability between each point. Missing values therefor have a disproportionate effect on the following visualizations.

The first graph represents a summation of the area for every country.
